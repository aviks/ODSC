    "The usual way of adding support for numerical linear algebra is by wrapping BLAS and LAPACK subroutines. For matrices with elements of `Float32`, `Float64`, `Complex{Float32}` or `Complex{Float64}` this is also what Julia does. For a long time Julia has also had support for multiplicaton of general element types. Hence, when multiplying integer matrices, the output is also an integer matrix"

The generic `LU` method in Julia applies pivoting and therefore the element type also has to support `<` and `abs`. Hence it is possible to solve systems of equations of e.g. rational numbers which the following examples show."
